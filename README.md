### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**KineticCode-Source/KineticCode-Source** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Developing autonomus test software
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flask
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, C++, Django, Flask
- âš¡ Fun fact: Angel underground station in London has the longest escalator of all underground stations in London, it's 60m high.
